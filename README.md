# Haskell in Haste

A (very) short workshop designed to introduce Haskell quickly but practically.

## Getting Started

This workshop is 

1. [Download Stack](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/wiki/Downloads) for your operating system
2. Clone this repository

         git clone https://github.com/charleso/haskell-in-haste.git

3. Run the `stack` executable in the root of the directory

## Haskell Overview

TODO This should probably live in a separate file

### Hello World

```haskell
main = putStrLn "Hello world"
```
