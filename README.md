# Haskell in Haste

A (very) short workshop designed to introduce Haskell quickly but practically.

## Getting Started

This workshop is 

1. [Download Stack](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/wiki/Downloads) for your operating system
2. Clone this repository

         git clone https://github.com/charleso/haskell-in-haste.git

3. Run `stack setup` in the root of the directory
4. Run `stack build` in the root of the directory

## Running

1. Run `stack ghci`
2. Type `main` and enter
3. Type ":r" to reload

## Introduction

See [here](Introduction.md) for the material to be used for teaching (very) basic Haskell.

Some concepts are intentionally not being covered due to the time available, which are listed [here](Avoid.md)

## Practical

It's _really_ important to remember that learning a new language can be tricky,
and Haskell especially so. Pick something really simple to start with and
don't feel bad or frustated if you don't finish.
There should be plenty of people floating around, ready to help and you
shouldn't hesitate to ask for help.
