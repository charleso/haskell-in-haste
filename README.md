# Haskell in Haste

A (very) short workshop designed to introduce Haskell quickly but practically.

## Getting Started

This workshop is 

1. [Download Stack](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/wiki/Downloads) for your operating system
2. Clone this repository

         git clone https://github.com/charleso/haskell-in-haste.git

3. Run `stack setup` in the root of the directory
4. Run `stack build` in the root of the directory

## Running

1. Run `stack ghci`
2. Type `main` and enter
3. Type ":r" to reload

## Introduction

See [here](Introduction.md) for the material to be used for teaching (very) basic Haskell.

Some concepts are intentionally not being covered due to the time available, which are listed [here](Avoid.md)
