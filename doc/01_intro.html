# Introduction

---
layout: false

## Goals

- Teaching the basics of Haskell
- Start coding

---

## What is Haskell?

- Strongly and statically typed language
- Purely functional programming language

---

## Why Haskell?

- Different way of thinking
  - Helps with other languages
- No mutation
  - Easier to reason about
- Safe code
  - Less bugs
- Fun!

---

## Warning

- This is _not_ about Functional Programming
- Not enough time :(
- Lots of good resources

---

## Stack

- `GHC` is the Haskell compiler
- `ghci` is the "GHC Interactive"
  - REPL (Read Eval Print Loop)
  - Similar to `python`, `ruby`, `node`
- `stack`
  - Downloads `ghc`
  - Resolves package dependencies

---

## Getting started

```
> stack ghci
Configuring GHCi with the following packages: haskell-in-haste
GHCi, version 7.10.2: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
...

```

## Loading a file

```
> :l src/Example.hs
[1 of 1] Compiling Example ( src/Example.hs, interpreted )
Ok, modules loaded: Example.
>
```

---

## Reloading a file

```
> :r
[1 of 1] Compiling Example ( src/Example.hs, interpreted )
Ok, modules loaded: Example.
>
```
